        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am in my last year of undergraduate study, majoring in computer science and engineering. I have always had great interest for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Besides technical knowledge, I have pursued a minor in management where I learned about strategic principles. My academic life has been a mixture between strategic thinking and technical skills which makes me suitable for any software development position. I have already gained some practical experience and I never lose my passion to create something new thus stand ready to bring my impact into this sphere. Having said that, my future path will be marked by an unending search for perfection coupled with determination that pushes boundaries as far as technological advancements are concerned.</p>
